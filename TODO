- Must write a Rscript that saves history.
  - How do we install this in R.home
  - ${R_HOME}/bin/BATCH explicitly sets -no-readline. This might be why
    there is no history in batch mode. Note
    - I tried simply removing the --no-readline option with no effect.
  - A better method might be to drill into how savehistory works.
